# Car Selector Backend
A small base for an interactive car selection screen, similar to those seen on car sale websites.
The solution comes with a list of all cars - in detail. Along with PHP code to automatically enter this information into a provided database.

And finally, a simple form from which to select cars for further detail.
The project is open source and you can do whatever you like with it.
